INSTRUCTIONAL MODULE TITLE:  	

Sleep Solutions with doTerra



TARGET AUDIENCE:	

New customers and Wellness Advocates with doTerra (an essential oils company) who are learning foundational information about sleep health products.
Why this instruction is needed	With the ongoing improvements in technology, researchers have been to learn more about sleep, average human sleep performance, issues in disturbances of the sleep phases, the connection to an overworked population, and the like. doTerra formulated new products to meet the demands of their customer base in solving issues in sleep health. Products in their Sleep Wellness Program, for example, are relatively new, so many are still learning about them and how to leverage them for improved overall health and wellness.



GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:	

With the completion of the module, trainees will have solid foundation of knowledge about the most effective (and most purchased) sleep products in the doTerra company. 

Trainees will:

--understand the difference between single oils and blends;

--immediately recall whether or not a given sleep product may be used aromatically, topically, or internally, so as to make the safest health decisions for themselves and, in the case of Wellness Advocates, give their customers accurate and educational answers to their questions;

--have a command of the information on the product overviews (such as therapeutic benefits and effective uses) of spotlight oils in this course (lavender, Serenity, and Breathe) that play big roles in the doTerra Sleep Wellness Program;

--collect diffuser blends recipes and DIYs shared in the course to add to their personal collection of remedies and detailed record of pertinent associated information (such as indications, contraindications, any adverse effects, and of course positive outcomes);

--do the activities described in the aforementioned recipes/DIY instructions to not only practice the processes but also to experience hands-on application.



DESCRIPTION OF OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNER PRACTICE AND FEEDBACK:	

In the course, the main lesson pages are named after the “spotlight” oils that are serving as the foundational material for sleep health products: Lavender, Serenity, and Breathe. On each of those lesson pages, I would estimate an equivalent of 8-10 slides; in combination with the overview and review sections, I definitely went over 25 slides. But also within the main lesson pages in the middle section (titled “DoTerra Sleep Solutions), there are 2-5 knowledge checks present for each page. The knowledge checks provide opportunity for learner practice and feedback—that is, formative assessment. I provided at least brief feedback for all questions; for several of them, I provided more details so that they would serve as another opportunity for trainees to review material. 



DESCRIPTION OF HOW LEARNERS ARE ASSESSED:	

The aforementioned knowledge checks, as well as the post-test on the next-to-last training page provide immediate feedback based on students’ performance. Both the knowledge checks and the post-test involve a few different question designs (multiple choice, matching, etc.). 



COMMENTS:	

I’ll mention that I was really looking forward to using Storyline more than Rise, but there were some technical issues the night I was trying to get the project rolling, and long story short, I ended up going with Rise on this project.

Having said that, I really, really enjoyed this project. It became rather addicting. My inner content creator mind has been very busy brainstorming lots of project ideas. Once I know that I’ve officially satisfied the IDT7090 requirements to the fullest extent I can (despite my health issue setting me back a little), and when I know I’m in the clear for a holiday “break,” I’m looking forward to experimenting with all I can do with the software and diving into more of their training opportunities—I noticed they hold a lot of them. 

Even though the project was a lot of work, it didn’t feel like work to me because I enjoyed it so much. I’m really glad I learned about this tool.
